# Planning presentation content

What counts as slide content? Anything writen or spoken, so content includes everything from slide titles to the slide notes to guide your talk. There is no consistent formula for the perfect presentation every time. There are only guidelines for creating _better_ presentation material, which you will review using our sample presentation slides.

## Learning goals:
- create a description of the example project's target audience
- list the content sections that are expectede in a data science presentation
- connect the presentation components with a narrative arc
- create an outline for your presentation


### create a description of the example project's target audience

Creating a good presentation is an exercise in empathy, putting yourself in the mindset of the audience before you start to create slides. So before you draft the outline of your presentation, describe the target audience for the presentation by answering these questions:

| **Question** | **Example Answer** |
|----------|----------------|
| 1. Who will be receiving your presentation and what is their roll in the company? |  Mid-level manager |
| 2. What is their background, technical or non-technical? | With a non-technical background |
| 3. How will your presentation affect their work or a decision they need to make? | make wait time shorter, reduce work load, prioritize workload, save lives, etc |
| 4. What is their attention span? | Extremely short  |
| 5. What is the goal of the presentation? | To convince the manager that your results will have such a large impact on the business, that you should be allowed to continue the next steps and future work of your analysis. |

Every bit of slide content will be filtered through the answers to those questions. 

**Extremely short attenion span?** ---> Concise text, attention grabbing titles, hook in the listener/reader <br>
**Non technical backgroun?** ---> Drop jargon, include only the most relevant information <br>
**Sign-off on your work continiuing?** ---> focus on  the real life impact of your work. Always tie your results to real world numbers and how the answers you provide are solutions to real problems.



## connect the presentation components with a narrative arc

In storytelling and narration there is conflict, resolution, and the journey in between. Your data science presentation can be arranged the same way. Plus, maintaining a narrative arc throughout your presentation will keep the audience engaged and help retention of information.

A great example of this is the children's book "Don't let pigeon drive the bus"
- Title reveals the main point of the story. It's catchy. It's not "An observation of avairy conflict in transportation permissions"
- Problem is established from the beginning - We've been told by the bus driver that pigeon wants to drive, but we are not to let him
- It's a children's book, rules are important, so we can assume that a **successful** endinig is one where we suceed in not letting pigeon ride the bus
- the book is filled with pigeon's attempts to convince us to let him ride the bus
- the bus driver returns and thanks us for not letting pigeon drive the bus

How is this related?
- Have a catchy title that reveals the answer and your findings
- Then establish the business problem and scenario at the beginning in detail (the conflict)
- With the answer already revealed, go through the most meaningful work that impacted the final result (the journey)
- At the end, revisit the original problem and tie the entire presentation together (the resolution and ever after)

In practical terms, your presentation should have three parts:
- Tell them what you're going to tell them
  - [ ] the problem
  - [ ] the solution
  - [ ] the data and tools you will use to solve it
- Tell them
  - [ ] A deeper description of the data and relevant variables
  - [ ] what type of problem the business problem is in statistial terms (prediction, optimization, classification, prediction)
  - [ ] The findings of your analysis
- Tell them what you told them
  - [ ] How your solution solves the business problem
  - [ ] How much better your solution is than the baseline model in solving the business problem
  - [ ] What impacts your confidence in the solution, limitations
  - [ ] How to build off your work with next steps and future work


## Exercise:

### Draft an outline of your presentation - how to draft the outline of a presentation
[at the slide level] - how many slides and what will each one contain?


At a minimum, your presentation materials should communicate the highlights of your analysis:

- [ ] introduction & business context (a few slides)
- [ ] data science process steps (another few slides)
- [ ] future improvement ideas ( 1 slide)
- [ ] contact info. (1 slide)

At this point do not worry about what goes in your slide versus what goes in your voice over. This step focuses on pairing **one key point** with **each slide** in your presentation.

#### What is a key point?

Is a key point that you had a R-squared of 87% or that your model had good predictive power?

The key points of your analysis should be there in your presentation, but only if the material can pass the "so what?" test. The "so what?" test is "So what does this information matter to me, your potential audience?" <br>
Use your audience persona to shape what you put in your presentation. A research scientist in the technical department of a company will have more interest in deep statistical tests than the CEO. If you are presenting to a coworker you sit two cubes away from - having a contact slide might be wierd.
