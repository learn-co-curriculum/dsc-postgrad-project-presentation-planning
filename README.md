Part 1: Content/Storytelling: 
If you've reached adulthood, by now you've probably seen a bad powerpoint or google slides presentation.
Creating a good presentation is an exercise in empathy, putting yourself in the mindset of the audience before you start to create slides. 

## Learning goals:
- create a description of the example project's target audience
- list the content sections that are expectede in a data science presentation
- connect the presentation components with a narrative arc
- review each bit of slide content with a few key questions

### create a description of the example project's target audience

Before you draft the outline of your presentation, describe the target audience for the presentation by answering these questions:
1. Who will be receiving your presentation?
2. What is their background, technical or non-technical?
3. What is the person's role in the company?
4. How will your presentatioon affect their work or a decision they need to make?
5. What is their attention span?

Every  presentation  needs to have a  goal: to inform,  to convince, to sell. The task of creatinng a  good presentation is to create an effective communication of your project in a condensed and efficient form. 


A data science project presentation is a condensed version of your project notebook with a goal: To convince someone to let you continue your research. 


Presentation correctly includes all required elements: 
- introduction
- data science process steps
- future improvement ideas
- contact info.


Guiding Questions:
How do you make your presentation, as a whole, effective in conveying a project? 
Who is your audience?
Including how to write a hook, how to think about your audience and craft a presentation for that audience (assuming mostly non-technical for our presentations), and make sure our results/recommendations/next steps are all tied to that initial 
‘So What’ hook that’s crafted at the beginning, NOT EVERYTHING you tried should be in the presentation
Look through all your content and say “does this directly apply to my answer? Can it be left out? Should it be left out?”
