# Planning presentation content

What counts as slide content? Anything writen or spoken, so content includes everything from slide titles to the slide notes to guide your talk. There is no consistent formula for the perfect presentation every time. There are only guidelines for creating _better_ presentation material, which you will review using our sample presentation slides.

## Learning goals:
- create a description of the example project's target audience
- list the content sections that are expectede in a data science presentation
- connect the presentation components with a narrative arc
- review each bit of slide content with a few key questions

### create a description of the example project's target audience

Creating a good presentation is an exercise in empathy, putting yourself in the mindset of the audience before you start to create slides. So before you draft the outline of your presentation, describe the target audience for the presentation by answering these questions:

| **Question** | **Example Answer** |
|----------|----------------|
| 1. Who will be receiving your presentation and what is their roll in the company? |  Mid-level manager |
| 2. What is their background, technical or non-technical? | With a non-technical background |
| 3. How will your presentation affect their work or a decision they need to make? | make wait time shorter, reduce work load, prioritize workload, save lives, etc |
| 4. What is their attention span? | Extremely short  |
| 5. What is the goal of the presentation? | To convince the manager that your results will have such a large impact on the business, that you should be allowed to continue the next steps and future work of your analysis. |

Every  presentation  needs to have a  goal: to inform,  to convince, to sell. The task of creatinng a  good presentation is to create an effective communication of your project in a condensed and efficient form. 


A data science project presentation is a condensed version of your project notebook with a goal: To convince someone to let you continue your research. 


Presentation correctly includes all required elements: 
- introduction
- data science process steps
- future improvement ideas
- contact info.


Guiding Questions:
How do you make your presentation, as a whole, effective in conveying a project? 
Who is your audience?
Including how to write a hook, how to think about your audience and craft a presentation for that audience (assuming mostly non-technical for our presentations), and make sure our results/recommendations/next steps are all tied to that initial 
‘So What’ hook that’s crafted at the beginning, NOT EVERYTHING you tried should be in the presentation
Look through all your content and say “does this directly apply to my answer? Can it be left out? Should it be left out?”
